        Hi, this website was created by me to curate and share the projects I have had the opportunity to work on. I also try to post blogs and other stuff you can check out.
        About me, I've been working as a solutions engineer at Clappia since 2022, and I graduated with a bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering in 2019.
